=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program does not exist yet. I am still musing about the
interface, for now, please see the file HOWTO.mirrorcpan in the
File::Rsync::Mirror::Recent distribution and follow the instructions
there.

The usual blurb: rersyncrecent is a project to get speedy rsync
operation on large trees over multiple hosts. It maintains a
collection of files with metadata (so called recentfiles) that
represent adjacent or overlapping timespans of file change events.

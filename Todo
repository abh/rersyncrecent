	* recommended update interval? Makes no sense, is different for differen
	users.

	* I just asked http://filext.com/file-extension/cent to discover that
	.cent would be unused:) RE.CENT is a symlink to (RECENT.yaml is a
	symlink to)? RECENT-1h.yaml? Doesn't sound completely useless.

	* Need to allow different serializers than yaml. Users may have a reason
	to choose something else.

	* I keep changing my mind about what the best shortest File is on my
	box. I see that the shortest file needs a special name like the zero
	file (A?). And that the user must get the effective interval from
	within. I want to call it RECENT.yaml. It could always be a symlink to
	our current favourite, right? Maybe need some symlink juggling?

	* consider if the one connection per file policy needs to be fixed. We
	would really like to download chunks of files that pay off one
	connection. Should be doable with --files-from option and a chunk size
	which so-to-say currently defaults to 1.

	* find out what it would need to implement and decide if we want to
	support symlinks, directories, sockets, etc.

	* Moosify

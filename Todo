	* Are we careful enough to make the mirroring of the RECENT file itself
	efficient? We should make a copy to the tempfile before we call rsync on
	it.

	* who must make the symlink? If it is just an ordinary method to create
	the symlink then we leave some burden to the user. From the nature, only
	update() is a candidate to do it. When the user switches the call to
	update from one interval to another, we should immediately reflect that
	in the symlink. RECENT.recent? RE.CENT is wrong because we must keep the
	basename in case somebody maintains multiple recentfiles with different
	basenames, like, say, security relevant files vs. full coverage. Or one
	with symlink trees. Or one with pruned trees.

	* new accssor z-interval specifies how often the Z file is updated
	against the filesystem. We probably want no epoch stamp on these
	entries. And we want to be able to filter the entries (e.g. no
	by-modules and by-category tree)

	* deletions of empty directories are currently not sent to the
	recentfile.

	* Fill the Z file. gc or fsck or both. Somehow we must get the old files
	into Z. We do not need the other files filled up with filesystem
	contents though.

	* need interface to query for a file in order to NOT call update on
	PAUSE a second time within a short time.

	* recommended update interval? Makes no sense, is different for
	different users.

	* I just asked http://filext.com/file-extension/cent to discover that
	.cent would be unused:) RE.CENT is a symlink to (RECENT.yaml is a
	symlink to)? RECENT-1h.yaml? Doesn't sound completely useless.

	* I keep changing my mind about what the best shortest File is on my
	box. I see that the shortest file needs a special name like the zero
	file (A?). And that the user must get the effective interval from
	within. I want to call it RECENT.yaml. It could always be a symlink to
	our current favourite, right? Maybe need some symlink juggling?

2008-07-08  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.7os6VVqR@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* find out what it would need to implement and decide if we want to
	support symlinks, directories, sockets, etc. Update 2008-07-20: nothing!
	rsync supports them and if the user writes symlinks and directories into
	the RECENT file, it should JUST WORK. (untested)

	* Moosify

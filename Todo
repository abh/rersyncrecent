	* I keep changing my mind about what the best shortest File is on my
	box. I see that the shortest file needs a special name like the zero
	file (A?). And that the user must get the effective interval from within.

	* consider if the one connection per file policy needs to be fixed. We
	would really like to download chunks of files that pay off one
	connection.

	* find out what it would need to implement and decide if we want to
	support symlinks, directories, sockets, etc.
